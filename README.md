# credit-risk-classification

Background

In this challenge, I leveraged various techniques to train and evaluate a model for assessing loan risk. The dataset provided contains historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company. The goal is to build a model capable of identifying the creditworthiness of borrowers.
